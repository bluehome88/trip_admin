Caring, honest, empathic and approachable, Dr Victoria is renowned for her warm and friendly approach. And, like the best type of friend, she’s not afraid to guide you towards the best solution for you if your initial ideas won’t help you get the results you want.

Dr Victoria opened the Alva Street clinic in 2008, having spent half a decade prior to that working on a peripatetic basis at other clinics. Having her own premises, designed and equipped to her own specifications meant that she was able to offer not just superb yet relaxed service, but also build up her own in-house team of experts.

An experienced dental surgeon – whose previous patients include the wife of the Sultan of Brunei – it was a fascination with facial aesthetics that led Dr Victoria to expand her skills and undertake training in this area. Having trained with the best in the business, both in the UK and overseas, Dr Victoria has built up an enviable reputation – and loyal client base – over the last ten years. When you visit the clinic look out for the photographs of Victoria with friends Jane Iredale, Patrick Holford, Zein Obagi and Mauricio De Miao some of the worlds visionaries in helping people look their best.",Accredited 6th May 2015,"Chemical Peels , Cryolipolysis , Dermal Fillers , Laser / IPL Treatment Pigmented/Vas… , Mesotherapy , Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy , Sclerotherapy , Sculptra , Teeth Whitening , Ultrasonic Skin Tightening , Wrinkle relaxing injections ",https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=%2855.9500310%2C+-3.2111996%29&zoom=15&size=240x240&markers=mid|red|%2855.9500310%2C+-3.2111996%29,","

The Centre of Excellence for all your Aesthetic Needs.

I enjoyed eight years as a registered nurse practitioner before moving into aesthetics. Committed to providing safe and effective anti-ageing solutions within a clinical environment, I set up Julie Pawson Aesthetics (formerly Timeless Aesthetics) in 2008. Having trained all over the world including at the world famous Harley Street clinic, I have brought some of the industry’s most innovative aesthetics methods to my clinic in the Ribble Valley.

Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh
 Acknowledged as one of the world’s premier cosmetic doctors, Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh is a master of the delicate art of cosmetic medicine, with a focus on the face and neck. Raised in France, Dr Sebagh began his career over 30 years ago after graduating from the University of Paris in 1979, where he earned his Medical Doctorate and became a qualified Cosmetic Facial Surgeon. From 1985 to 1988, he honed his skills with a pre-eminent plastic surgeon in Los Angeles, refining his style in modern beauty, before returning to practice in Paris. In 1994, Dr Sebagh opened his practice in London and pioneered the use of Botox, hyaluronic acid fillers and vitamin injections. Combining these techniques, Dr Sebagh coined the phrase “age-maintenance” to describe his revolutionary work to preserve existing youth and vibrancy and word soon spread about the doctor who could physically change skin by making it look younger without surgery. Renowned for his precise, subtle technique and notable yet natural looking results, Dr Sebagh not only makes his patients look younger, he makes them look better.

Dr Diana Piana-Mariton
 Widely acknowledged as one of the most experienced specialist cosmetic doctors in her chosen field, Dr Diana Piana-Mariton has established a reputation as the doctor to consult when seeking age-maintenance treatments that require the latest advances in the use of Fraxel, Ultrasound, Radio Frequency and IPL. Doctor of Medicine and Surgery, qualified at the University of Paris and Flower Fifth Avenue and New York University Medical Center 1977, Dr Piana-Mariton has been specialising in Cosmetic Dermatology since 1999 and has been a Certified Laser Specialist since 2002. She has practiced in London since 2004. Dr Piana-Mariton works closely with Dr Sebagh and other members of his clinic to treat patients with state-of-the-art and effective non-invasive treatments for skin rejuvenation and enhancement. Her approach is based on obtaining “glowing, radiant skin” by techniques that stimulate the natural “healing” capacity of your skin to generate new collagen, elasticity and firmness. As well having great knowledge and expertise, Dr Piana-Mariton also has a reassuringly professional yet warm manner that allows patients to feel relaxed and at ease when with her.

Dr Anne Mendelovici
 Since joining Dr Sebagh’s Clinic in London in 2006, Dr Anne Mendelovici has established herself as a key member of the team, creating a niche for herself as an aesthetic doctor of great skill and with a natural eye for carrying out anti-ageing treatments that produce a natural and beautiful result. Now specialising in the use of Botox, fillers, Meso Glow and Silhouette Soft, French born Dr Mendelovici qualified at the Medical University Hospital Lariboisière Saint Louis, Paris in 2003 and now works closely with Dr Sebagh, honing her skills and expanding her realm of expertise. Today, Dr Mendelovici has an extensive roster of regular patients who are drawn to her skills as an aesthetic doctor, as well as her considered and gentle manner. It is testament to her skills that she counts many of London’s leading beauty editors as regular patients, who know that seeing her or Dr Sebagh will ensure that they will benefit from the expert eye of a leader in her field. 

Dr Anna Marie Olsen
 Though Dr Anna Marie Olsen may be the latest doctor to join Dr Sebagh and his colleagues at the London Clinic, she does so having acquired extensive qualifications and experience at both the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece and Queen Mary University London. A Doctor in Clinical Dermatology, Dr Olsen has studied and gained extensive experience and knowledge in the treatment of male and female pattern baldness and the use of the latest technology to treat patients with successful hair transplant operations. Though softly spoken and modest in her approach, Dr Olsen is passionate about her specialist field of expertise and has quickly established herself as a key member of Dr Sebagh’s team, producing results which have far exceeded her patients’ expectations. In addition to the treatment of male and female pattern baldness, Dr Olsen is also able to utilise her skills to successfully transplant individual hair follicles to the eyebrows and even eyelashes, if required.",Accredited 7th May 2015,"Dermal Fillers , Fractional Laser Skin Resurfacing , LED Acne Treatment and Skin Repair/… , Laser / IPL Treatment Pigmented/Vas… , Laser Hair Removal , Laser Skin Rejuvenation , Medical Skin Needling , Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy , Radiofrequency For Facial Rejuvenation , Thread Lifting , Wrinkle relaxing injections ",https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=%2851.5187311%2C+-0.1482749%29&zoom=15&size=240x240&markers=mid|red|%2851.5187311%2C+-0.1482749%29,","

I have 25 years of nursing experience the last 9 years I have held senior positions – Team Leader at NHS 24, Nursing Home Manager, Manager of outpatient pre-operative assessment team and Senior Charge Nurse of a stroke rehabilitation unit for the past 5 years. In 2004-2006 I went back to university and successfully gained my Bachelor of Nursing Degree. In 2013 I returned to university and successfully gained my independent presciber’s qualification.
 In 2010 I successfully studied beauty therapy at Arbroath College while working as the outpatient team manager. I have been to Harley Street in the past month to learn micro-pigmentation. I have also done numerous courses to enable me to do wrinkle reducing injections, dermal fillers, rejuvenating facial peels both glycolic and TCA peels, derma roller treatment.
 I have recently resigned from my role as Senior Charge Nurse to concentrate on this new direction for my career. I feel that now I am older I am ready to face the challenge of being self-employed and working more flexible hours to hopefully achieve a much improved work – life balance in an area which has always fascinated me.

Here at Lambs Aesthetics, I offer the professionalism of a clinic, in a welcoming, homely environment. I seek to establish the ideal treatment for your individual needs, with free, honest consultations and no obligation.

As we age, skin cells divide more slowly and the inner skin (dermis) starts to thin. The fat cells beneath the dermis weaken, whilst the underlying network of collagen and elastin fibres loosen and unravel, losing elasticity. Over time, the skin loses its ability to retain moisture and repair itself as we lose Hyaluronic acid concentration in the skin. Thus, frown lines and crow’s feet develop because of persistent muscle contractions.

Dr Aarti Narayan-Denning is a fully registered GP and Aesthetic Doctor in Aesthetic Medicine. She carries out all our injectable treatments including botox and dermal fillers. She is Board Certified by the The American Academy Of Aesthetic Medicine, and is an Assistant Trainer for the their UK chapter.

She commenced her training in non-surgical cosmetic treatments in 2009, starting with Botox, dermal fillers and peels. She then went on to work with National cosmetic treatment provider Cosmedoctor between 2010 and 2012.
 From 2012 she carried out medical cosmetic treatments and consultations for Evolutions in Winchester until December 2015.

She also consults weekly at Changes Clinic in Portsmouth.
 Beyond the standard injectables such as botox and dermal fillers, Aarti is adept in the full spectrum of non-surgical cosmetic treatments, such as platelet rich plasma therapy, thread lift (PDO and Silhouette Soft) procedures and intralipotherapy (fat removal injections).

She performs a Specialist Aesthetic assessment of face structure and aging patterns to determine the combination of treatments that will work best for each patient. Her aesthetic approach is based on multicultural beauty “Phi” analysis, which ensures that treatments are based on each patient’s face, and avoids the distorted results that occur when people treat “just the nose to mouth line” or “just the top lip”.
She is trained to assess skin lesions such as moles, skin tags, thread veins and manage appropriately or advise on onward referral to a specialist.

She attends regular CPD (continuing professional development) training in aesthetics to ensure she is up to date in technical and pharmacological practice, knowledge base and evidence underpinning the procedures she carries out.
 Dr Narayan-Denning sees herself as a Doctor and GP first and then an Aesthetic Doctor. She believes in the principle of Primum Non Nocere – Latin for “First do no Harm” from the Hippocratic Oath, and will readily inform a patient if she feels their choice of procedure could be unsafe for them. If she thinks a patient may be unable to perform the aftercare require, she will suggest they postpone their treatment to a more suitable time.

Some clients may find this approach dramatically different from the sales-driven pitches they have been used to.

But most well-informed patients, clients “in-the-know”, and expert aesthetic patients find this a refreshing change, and have remained delighted customers for years.

It is a sad truth that peer pressure and social media often result in inappropriate requests for cosmetic treatments from young or vulnerable people, and unfortunately from parents who succumb to their children’s requests for temporary enhancements like botox and fillers. Agreeing to these requests may be a short term fix, but often leads to a lifetime of insecurity and a dysmorphic approach to face, food, figure and relationships.

In the best interests of patients, Dr. Denning requests that all patients seeking cosmetic enhancements be at least 21 years of age (and definitely above 18 for consultation).

Martina Collins is a fully qualified dental surgeon who believes in listening to patients’ needs and expectations above all else. Martina works closely with her patients to achieve results they are happy with as well as meeting her own exceptional standards.

Having qualified from Queens University in 1998, Martina has worked in private practice from 2002 and is currently a dentist at Lisburn Road Dental and Implant Clinic where she has pursued a special interest in orthodontics for over 10 years. Taking a holistic approach to teeth straightening, she practises early interceptive treatments in young children designed to encourage normal jaw development and prevent extractions. Martina believes that many orthodontic issues in the teenage years can be prevented with early diagnosis. As for adults whose confidence is hampered by misshapen teeth, Martina believes there is an orthodontic solution to suit every individual’s situation. She treats relapsed orthodontic issues for adults and offers specialist cosmetic solutions such as the ‘Inman Aligner’, cosmetic braces and invisible aligners.

Noticing her patients’ over-arching pursuit of a better more confident self-image, Martina expanded her interest in orthodontics and embarked on further study in anti-wrinkle injections and dermal fillers almost 10 years ago. With a deep respect for individuals and a belief that injection therapies should be highly customised and planned for each patient, Martina gained a reputation for sensitivity to patients needs and consistently achieving a natural look for her patients.",Accredited 13th July 2015,"Chemical Peels , Dermal Fillers , Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy , Wrinkle relaxing injections ",https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=%2854.5773431%2C+-5.9530870%29&zoom=15&size=240x240&markers=mid|red|%2854.5773431%2C+-5.9530870%29,","

I specialise, and have over 18 years experience, in the use of lasers, Botox and many other injectable aesthetic procedures, having developed an interest in Cosmetic Dermatology during 1993. I joined MediZen as Clinical Director in 1999 as one of the very few medical practitioners in the UK to have undertaken clinical trials on the use of all 3 of the UK licensed brands of the world’s most popular injectable cosmetic treatment, Botulinum toxin.

Over the years I have sought and received personal training from worldwide experts in their field, including Dr Jean Carruthers, the doctor credited with first identifying the potential for Botox as an aesthetic treatment in Canada in the late 1980’s.

As I have grown in my expertise, I have in turn enjoyed training other practitioners, and have personally trained over 1,000 Doctors on injection technique in the use of Botox for cosmetic purposes and excessive sweating, and the use of dermal fillers for facial contouring.

This has led me to be recognised as an International Key Opinion Leader and I have been appointed a Local Country Ambassador by Allergan (the world’s largest cosmetic injectables supplier and the manufacturer of Botox). This means that I also travel widely, training and mentoring other medical practitioners on the safe and correct use of botulinum toxin and dermal fillers. Over the years I’ve been asked to help people who have received incorrect or poor treatment from other providers and am now recognised as an expert in managing complications of injectables, receiving referrals from other practitioners on the rare occasions things do not go as planned.

Yinka Aroyewun, the founder of Yinka MediSpa, started her career as a registered nurse in the NHS more than 25 years ago. It was the perfect fit for her scientific mind and generous demeanour. But Yinka views life as a constant pursuit to improve – herself, her skills and her contributions – and thus she wanted to do more to help others. That’s when an idea was born.

Yinka realised her nursing skills could help women recreate themselves and rediscover confidence – especially as they age. Becoming an aesthetic nurse was about empowering women and linking what they saw on the outside with how they felt on the inside. 

Beauty and insecurity can be wrapped in emotion that’s difficult to dissect, so Yinka’s approach is delicate.

How beauty varies in nature and art.
 In a woman the flesh must be like marble;
 in a statue the marble must be like flesh.
 Victor Hugo

Our aim at YourGP is to help you look – and feel – great.

Audrey Hepburn might have thought that “the beauty of a woman grows with the passing years” but many of us are likely to disagree! Loosening of the skin, wrinkles, age spots, loss of facial definition, loss of firmness and glow are all things many women – and men – would rather avoid! 

Non surgical cosmetic treatments have evolved massively over the years and offer a very effective and convenient solution to everyone. When administered correctly by experienced and well trained clinicians this is a safe, easy and effective way of holding back the signs of ageing and of dealing with many aesthetic difficulties. There are however a very wide range of cosmetic treatments and you need to ensure you get the right combination for you.

Spending time with each patient to carefully ascertain what are your areas of concern, and what you want to achieve, our kind, highly trained and experienced clinicians will explain all the alternatives available. They will then tailor a treatment plan to suit you, your skin and what you want to achieve. Your consultation is free of charge.

Using only quality, licensed products and in a simple, quick and non-invasive manner our medical practitioners can help you with:

Wrinkles and lines
 Loss of facial definition
 Acne, spots & blemishes
 Reducing scar and burn marks
 Unwanted hair
 Skin complaints
 Chin & neck treatments
 Lip definition

Ruth graduated from Liverpool University Dental School in 1981. She has spent the last 34 years as a partner in general dental practice with her husband John. In 2004 she started training in facial aesthetics and introduced this into her practice. She is now virtually retired from dentistry and her time is spent largely carrying out facial aesthetic work, a subject which she is passionate about. 

Ruth has undertaken further extensive postgraduate training to ensure that she keeps abreast of current techniques and is at the cutting edge of advances in this field. Her manual skills, combined with an in-depth knowledge of the anatomy of the head and neck means that she can treat a wide variety of cases.

In addition carrying out facial aesthetics at Dental Excellence Harewood, a prestigious teaching centre on the Harewood House Estate near Leeds, Ruth is involved as an instructor at a prominent teaching institute for facial aesthetics in Berkshire. In recognition of her work in the field, Ruth has been invited to be on the panel of judges for the FMC facial aesthetic awards in 2016.

Ruth was invited to join the team at Dental Excellence Harewood in 2014. Here she uses her skills and knowledge of facial aesthetics to complement the work of the other specialists in the team, in some cases delivering a more conservative way of treating some dental problems. Using the most up to date techniques utilising cannulae rather than needles, she is able to reduce ‘down-time’ to a minimum and allowing patients to return to work or social activities quicker.

Ruth is a great believer in natural results, consistent with normal anatomy. In her in-depth consultations, Ruth tries to understand exactly what her patient’s concerns are and what they are wanting to achieve. It is important that both patient and operator have a clear view of objectives and expectations before treatment commences.

Ruth’s fields of expertise include:

* Forehead lines, frown lines and crow’s feet
 * Lip augmentation
 * Cheek augmentation including tear troughs
 * Non-surgical rhinoplasty (improving the shape of the nose)
 * Chin and jaw line augmentation
 * Threads (non-surgical facelift)
 * Anhydrosis (control of underarm sweating)
 * Skin boosters to re-hydrate the skin",Accredited 10th December 2015,"Dermal Fillers , Lip Enhancement , Mesotherapy , Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy , Thread Lifting , Wrinkle relaxing injections ",https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=%2853.9005291%2C+-1.5126518%29&zoom=15&size=240x240&markers=mid|red|%2853.9005291%2C+-1.5126518%29,","
